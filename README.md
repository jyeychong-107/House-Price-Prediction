# 🏡 House Price Prediction Data Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes the **Ames Housing dataset** to study key factors affecting house prices.  
The workflow covers **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and regression modeling**, followed by an **interactive Power BI dashboard** to present insights and predictions.

## 🔑 Objectives
- Perform **data cleaning and preprocessing** on housing data.  
- Conduct **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to identify trends and correlations.  
- Implement and compare **Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting** models.  
- Evaluate models using **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**.  
- Build a **Power BI dashboard** to communicate findings and predictions.  

## 📊 Data Analysis Steps
1. **Data Import & Cleaning**  
   - Handle missing values, encode categorical features, and normalize data.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualize distributions, correlations, and key housing features.  
3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Create new features (e.g., Total SF = basement + 1st + 2nd floor).  
   - Select top features using correlation and importance scores.  
4. **Modeling**  
   - Train Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting.  
   - Perform **cross-validation** and **hyperparameter tuning**.  
5. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Compare models using **RMSE**.  
   - Best model: *Gradient Boosting*.  
6. **Dashboard Development**  
   - Build **Power BI dashboard** to display housing insights and predictions.  

## 🚀 Results
- Trained on **1,460 housing records**.  
- Achieved **15% lower RMSE** after feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning.  
- Delivered an interactive Power BI dashboard for stakeholders.  

## 🔧 Future Improvements
- Deploy the model as a **web application** (e.g., Streamlit/Flask).  
- Expand dataset for better generalization.  
- Explore advanced models (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost).  
- Automate Power BI refresh with updated predictions.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn  
- **Visualization**: Power BI  
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub
